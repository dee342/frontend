> Frontend is a light-weight, no-bloat frontend development framework. It's purpose is to give developers a jumpstart utilizing Gulp to automate repetitive tasks, a variables file to quickly configure base elements and a standards-driven approach to help avoid spaghetti code while decreasing new developer ramp-up time.

**If you're viewing this at https://github.com/bmarshall511/frontend, you're reading the documentation for the master branch.
[View documentation for the latest release.](https://github.com/bmarshall511/frontend/tree/latest#readme)**

Unlike other frontend frameworks like [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), Frontend doesn't restrict you to any one in particular. You could think of Frontend like a base framework for others like Foundation and Bootstrap. Use what you like, discard what you don't â€” keeping your files well optimized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io)

### Direct download

Download the script [here](https://github.com/bmarshall511/frontend/archive/latest.zip) and include it (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else).

### Installation

Navigate to the frontend directory in Terminal and run the following commands:

1. ```$ bundle install``` To install gem dependencies
2. ```$ npm install``` To install dependencies
3. ```$ gulp setup``` For first-time setup

## Development Usage

The following commands can be run in the frontend directory during development:

- ```$ gulp``` Compiles for live environments
- ```$ gulp compile``` Compiles then watches for changes to files to re-compile (useful during development)
- ```$ gulp setup``` First-time setup **(only run once or your variables will be overridden)**
- ```$ gulp variables``` Create a application variables file **(only run once or your variables will be overridden)**
- ```$ gulp lint``` Lints JavaScript files:
- ```$ gulp scripts``` Lints and compiles JavaScript files
- ```$ gulp compass``` Compiles Sass files
- ```$ gulp images``` Minifies images
- ```$ gulp scss-lint``` Lints SCSS files
