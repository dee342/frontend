# Frontend v1.0.0
> A light-weight, skeleton frontend framework.

Frontend was created to give frontend developers a jumpstart when building new themes and sites. It's a light-weight, no bloat, skeleton framework that utilizes [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile stylesheets, JavaScript files and images in a organized, easy to navigate folder structure.

## Features

* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Development task manager
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - CSS authoring framework
* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) - JavaScript code quality tester
* [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) - Image minifier
* [Singularity](https://github.com/at-import/Singularity) - Grid framework
* [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) - Sass media queries

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up setup in a new theme. See compiling for notes on how to compile the code while developing.

### Prerequisites

* [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

### Installing

[Download](https://github.com/bmarshall511/frontend/archive/master.zip) and extract the Frontend files to your project folder. Then run the following in Terminal from that location:
